# GDXR

GDXR IS EXTREMELY EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT SO MOST (if not all) FEATURES MIGHT NOT EVEN PROPERLY WORK YET!!

GDXR is VR "Framework" for gdevelop made using Babylon.js and WebXR

>( i only test this with my Meta Quest 2 )

[Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) mixed with [WebXR](https://immersiveweb.dev/) Documentation can be found [here](https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/featuresDeepDive/webXR/introToWebXR)!
